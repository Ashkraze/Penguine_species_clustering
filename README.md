Penguin Species Classification Using Clustering

In this project, I employed clustering techniques to classify different species of penguins. The process involved several key steps in data engineering to ensure the quality and reliability of the data:

Outlier Treatment: Identifying and handling outliers to maintain data integrity.
Standardization: Transforming data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
Scaling: Adjusting the range of data features to a standard scale.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance.
After these preprocessing steps, I applied clustering algorithms to classify the penguin species effectively.
